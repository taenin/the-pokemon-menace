# The Pokémon Menace

###Overview

The Pokémon Menace utilizes a modified implementation of [Donald Michie's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Michie) MENACE in an attempt to learn the turn based game Pokémon. The bot is currently implemented as an extension for Google Chrome, so gameplay is only support on [Pokémon Showdown](http://pokemonshowdown.com/).

###Setup
- Clone the repo or download the Extension folder
- Using Google Chrome, navigate to your extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`. Enable developer mode, load an unpacked extension (select the "Extension" folder you previously downloaded), and disable developer mode.
