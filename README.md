# The Pokémon Menace

###Overview

The Pokémon Menace utilizes a modified implementation of [Donald Michie's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Michie) MENACE in an attempt to learn the turn based game Pokémon. The bot is currently implemented as an extension for Google Chrome that injects code directly into the browser, so gameplay is only support on [Pokémon Showdown](http://pokemonshowdown.com/).

##Setup
- Clone the repo or download the Extension folder
- Using Google Chrome, navigate to your extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`. Enable developer mode, load an unpacked extension (select the "Extension" folder you previously downloaded), and disable developer mode.

##Using the Extension
To use the extension, open [Pokémon Showdown](http://pokemonshowdown.com/) and select "Play Online".
Open the Chrome console and verify that the extension is functioning correctly. Amongst other messages, you should see:

`Bot Script Injected Successfully`
